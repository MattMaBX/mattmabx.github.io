I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Computer and Information Technology, Shanxi University, under the supervision of Prof. [Ru Li](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ru-Li-14829601) and Prof. [Víctor Gutiérrez Basulto](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L2eFo5IAAAAJ).

My primary research interests include Natural Language Processing and Frame Semantics. I am currently focused on the knowledge memorization capabilities of Large Language Models, with particular emphasis on their ability to understand and model semantic scenarios.
